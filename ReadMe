# These programs creates a collection of subplot histograms of offensive and 
# defensive ratings. The rating system was developed by me. The ratings histograms
# represent a distribution of skill which a given team can play at These ratings 
# are for power5/G5 conferences. Teams can be compared in different conferences
# or across the same conference.

#The paths for the data files that the programs read in will have to be adjusted
